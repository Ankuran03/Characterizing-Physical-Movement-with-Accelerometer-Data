Project objective: Extract time series features for human activity monitoring using accelerometer data from 15 subjects for walking, running, climbing up and climbing down activities, using only data from the head and chest sensor positions from the dataset available at https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/projects/activity-recognition/#dataset_realworld.

Task 1:

Apply NVG and HVG methods
Compute average degree, network diameter, average path length
Select sample size of 1024 data points for each subject
Tabulate results
Generate scatter plots: avg. degree vs network diameter, color-coded for walking/running and climbing up/down.

Task 2:

Compute permutation entropy and complexity
Vary parameters: embedded dimension (3-6), embedded delay (1-3), signal length (1024-4096)
Generate scatter plots: permutation entropy vs complexity, color-coded for walking/running and climbing up/down.
